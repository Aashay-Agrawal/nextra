# Finding your Gold Pot.

I have been exploring and searching for something that I truly love and enjoy during the last two years of college. I don't think I have found it yet, but I have discovered something close to it. Now that I have finally stumbled upon that gold pot, it is time to grind extremely hard.

What I have found is design engineering. I have realized that I love design and prototyping, and design engineering is the perfect blend of both.

My plan for the next six months:
- Become extremely proficient in React, Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, and Framer
- Build a presence on social media to increase my chances of success
- Get really good at creating novel prototypes and designs
- Build some great projects and hopefully get an internship

**I am so tired of my mediocre and mundane life that I want to change everything about it. I can't live anymore like this.**
