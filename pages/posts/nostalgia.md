# Nostalgia

I am forgetting my childhood; it feels like I have no memories of it, neither do I have photos. At this point, I don't even remember the cartoons I used to watch, my winter break in nani ghar, those fights with siblings, things I used to do in school, my childhood friends, that summer vacation in my village and so many more things that I don't even remember. All these memories are in some part of my brain, but there is no way to access them. Sometimes, I get flashbacks of some particular moments which are in my core memory while doing something, but not the entire thing. One of the reasons why I picked up sketching and illustrations in 2024 is just to remember and preserve all those memories,I don't want to lose them just because I am getting older and getting busier with life.
