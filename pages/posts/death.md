## **Death**

Death is a topic that no one really likes to discuss, perhaps because everyone is too afraid of it. However, death is inevitable; it is coming for all of us, and no one is prepared for it. For quite some time, I have been contemplating the fact that everyone around me will die one day. Sooner or later, it will happen, and I am not prepared for it. I am not prepared to handle the grief and pain. I am not ready to live a lonely life, where there is no one for me, where I have no one to love.

There is a verse in the Gita:

> Every single day, people die, yet the living think they are immortal.

This is quite true in the modern world, where the primary purpose of life seems to be working and making money. We start taking everything for granted and live as if we are immortal.
