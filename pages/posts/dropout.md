# I wish I could dropout...

From the first day of college, I knew this degree and place were not for me. I wasn't born to be in this place. I had all the privileges of life, but I still couldn't drop out because I didn't know what I wanted to do in my life. After two years of college, I figured out what I wanted to do, but I can't leave this place. I have already invested two years of my life here, and no college would admit a 20-year-old dropout. The only reason I am pursuing this engineering degree is so that I don't face any issues while applying for jobs and visas. Apart from that, there is literally no reason for me to continue this degree. I absolutely hate doing things which I don't like. I wish my 18-year-old self had known what he wanted to do in life, so he could have pursued a better degree and not have to suffer and rotten like me here.
